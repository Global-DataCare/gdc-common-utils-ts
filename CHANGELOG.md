# Changelog

All notable changes to `gdc-common-utils-ts` will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.20] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- Documented npm publish authentication flow using `NPM_TOKEN` loaded from `~/.zshrc`.

## [1.4.19] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- Canonicalized legal-representative occupation extraction to support `credentialSubject.hasOccupation.identifier.value`.
- Kept backward-compatible normalization for legacy role tokens (`|RESPRSN`, `v3-RoleCode|RESPRSN`) while validating against canonical code value.

## [1.4.17] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- Added shared activation representative policy utils in `src/utils/activation-policy.ts`:
  - DID extraction for credentials (`extractDidWebFromCredential`)
  - legal representative policy validation (`validateActivationRepresentativePolicy`)
  - member DID helpers (`buildMemberDidWeb`, `isMemberDidWebUnderOwner`) with canonical `:member:<member-id>:<role>` shape.
- Added tests in `__tests__/utils-activation-policy.test.ts` for representative policy and member DID hierarchy.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- Added VP token builder helpers in `utils/vp-token`:
  - `addVCs(vpPayload, vcs)` for batch VC append
  - `addOrganizationCredential(...)` with VC type guard
  - `addLegalRepresentativeCredential(...)` with VC type guard
- Added canonical schema.org person claims for controller/legal-representative activation flows:
  - `org.schema.Person.memberOf.taxID`
  - `org.schema.Person.hasCredential.material`
- Added unit test coverage for the new claim constants.
- Added canonical DocumentReference claim key:
  - `DocumentReference.contenthash`
  - included in claim specs and FHIR path mapping guidance.
- Added interoperable claim catalogs for:
  - `AllergyIntolerance.*`
  - `Condition.*`
  - `DeviceUseStatement.*`
- Added bidirectional flat-claims converters for:
  - `MedicationStatement`
  - `AllergyIntolerance`
  - `Condition`
  - `DeviceUseStatement`
  - `DocumentReference`
- Added roundtrip and validation tests:
  - `__tests__/utils-clinical-resource-converters.test.ts`

### Changed
- Clarified Communication/DocumentReference conversion profile docs and JSDoc:
  - atomic profile constraints are explicit profile rules (not native FHIR limitations),
  - DocumentReference semantics distinguish logical identifier vs content hash/CID.

### Notes
- These claims are intended to support the ICA -> GW trust chain used in `_activate`:
  - `memberOf.taxID` binds representative to organization (`Organization.identifier.value`).
  - `hasCredential.material` binds the representative signing key used to sign `vp_token`.
