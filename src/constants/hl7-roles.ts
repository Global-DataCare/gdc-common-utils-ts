 * Functional tags accepted by the GDC `RelatedPerson.role` flat-claim
 * extension. They do not replace `RelatedPerson.relationship`: kinship belongs
 * in `relationship`, while these comma-separated values describe an explicit
 * operational or legal function. CAREGIVER/ECON/DEPEN use v3-RoleClass;
 * RESPRSN/BILL/POWATT use v3-RoleCode. `POWATT` must only be assigned when a
 * real power of attorney exists; it is never inferred from controller status.
 * The bare CSV is resolved through the descriptors below when a Coding system
